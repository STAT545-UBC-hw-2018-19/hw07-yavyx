First, load the package:

```{r}
library(sportsPolitics)
```

The data is automatically loaded:

```{r}
sportsPolitics
```

The data is in a tidy format, so it is very easy to do any kind of analysis with it.

The function `plot_sport()` plots the selected sport's search percentage against the Trump voting percentage for the sport selected. The default value `sport = all` plots all sports at the same time. 

```{r}
plot_sport()

plot_sport("MLB")
```
